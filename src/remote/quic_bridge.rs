//! Local Unix-socket bridge that carries the framed client protocol over an
//! SSH-bootstrapped QUIC connection, with the SSH stdio bridge as fallback.
//!
//! The bridge listens on a private local socket exactly like
//! [`super::attach::SshStdioBridge`]: the thin client connects to it and
//! speaks the ordinary `ClientMessage`/`ServerMessage` protocol. Each accepted
//! connection runs the transport ladder once — cached credential or SSH
//! bootstrap, QUIC dial, live pump, SSH fallback — and every frame it carries
//! is opaque. The only frames the bridge originates are health pings toward
//! the server, which drive path liveness when the client has none in flight,
//! and local-only transport status hints toward the thin client.
//!
//! One close policy: when a live QUIC connection ends, or the ladder gives up,
//! the local socket is closed. The server saw an ordinary client connection,
//! so resuming needs a fresh `Hello` and only the thin client's supervisor can
//! send one; its next connection reuses the cached credential and skips SSH.
